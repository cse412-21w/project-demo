### Install

#### Required software

You must have Node.js installed. You can get it directly from
https://nodejs.org/en/.

#### Install dependecies

Once you've got `node`, run the command `npm install` in this project folder
and it will install all of the project-specific dependencies (if you're curious open up `package.json` to see where these are listed).

npm is the _node package manager_.


## Other notes

### Using 3rd party libraries

You are more than welcome to use open source packages such as D3.js, just make sure to cite these.

To add a new one run `npm install --save <library-name>`, e.g. `npm install --save d3`. This will
add the library locally so it is available for use in your JS files. It will also add `d3` to the
list of dependencies in `package.json`.

_Note that if you install a library your teammates will need to install it too. Once the dep is added
to `package.json` simply running `npm install` in this directory will download the new dependency._
